At the menu page, choose "Random Mode", "Edit Mode" or "Exit" by typing in "1", "2" or "0".
* Random Mode: The orginal cells' living or no is random.
* Edit Mode: The orginal cells' living or no is up to you.

At the setting page, type in the settings below in order:
* WIDTH: The width of the cell's board.
* HEIGHT: The height of the cell's board.
* NUM_CROWDED: If the num of a cell's "neighbors" is over (or equal to) it, then the cell will die.
* NUM_LONELY: If the num of a cell's "neighbors" is below (or equal to) it, then the cell will die.
* For example: If NUM_CROWDED is 4 and NUM_LONELY is 1, then it is a orginal game of life.
